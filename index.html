    <br>
    Parrots, belonging to the order Psittaciformes, are renowned for their vibrant plumage, distinctive curved beaks, and zygodactyl feet. With over 393 species worldwide, these intelligent birds display remarkable vocal mimicry, often mimicking human speech and various sounds. Popular as pets due to their social nature, parrots require interactive environments and a balanced diet rich in fruits and nuts. In their natural habitats, they contribute to ecosystems through seed dispersal. However, parrots face conservation challenges such as habitat loss and the illegal pet trade, emphasizing the need for concerted efforts to protect and preserve these captivating avian species.
